# Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a basic vulnerability scanner script implemented in Python. It scans websites for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and generates a report.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Scan**: Checks for SQL Injection vulnerabilities using common payloads.
- **XSS Scan**: Checks for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities using common payloads.
- **CSRF Scan**: Placeholder for CSRF vulnerability detection.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Required Python packages (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`)

```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner.git
cd vulnerability-scanner

Edit scanner.py to specify URLs you want to scan.
Run the scanner:
python scanner.py

View the generated report in templates/report.html.
